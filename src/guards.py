"""Guard synthesis -- the 'prevent' half of the goal.

The condition a patch enforces is derived from the WINNING REGION, never from "this item is
mentioned nearby". That distinction is the whole reason `patch.py` is disabled: its syntactic
core could not tell a protective item from a lethal one, and it shipped a guard that FORCED the
fatal Spinach_Dip and ANDed two OR-alternatives, making LSL2 unwinnable.

The rule here:

    guard(gate) = OR over the HOPEFUL paths of that gate, of their path condition,
                  keeping item literals -- positive AND negative.

`hopeful` is the same goal-reachability predicate the TRAP rule uses (missability.hopeful): can
the goal still be reached after taking this path. So a branch that kills you, or that strands you
where the goal is gone, contributes nothing to the guard -- while a branch that survives
contributes exactly its own() requirements.

On LSL2's raft gauntlet (rm138, the edge the old patcher broke) the lift carries the full ordered
`cond`, negations included:

    DEATH   : own(8) &  own(13)                          <- dip kills you even holding a good item
    EXIT 42 : own(8) & !own(13) &  own(12)
    EXIT 42 : own(8) & !own(13) & !own(12) & own(11)
    DEATH   : own(8) & !own(13) & !own(12) & !own(11)

so the derived guard is `own(8) & !own(13) & (own(12) | own(11))` -- it FORBIDS the very item the
old patch REQUIRED. Same edge, opposite conclusion, because the rule is semantic.

This module only DERIVES and reports specs. It writes no game files.

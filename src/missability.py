"""Missability sweep on the JSON-IR / smv_emit3 front-end (the canonical one), NOT the stale
model.Game / analyze.py front-end that search.py was left on.

search.py's SCC-condensation *algorithm* (tarjan_scc, reobtainable_rooms/_sealed,
edge_strandings, analyze) is sound and front-end-agnostic -- it operates on a generic
(room-graph, item-sources, required-set, goal) interface. This module builds that interface
from the JSON-IR OpEmitter so the sweep inherits every extraction fix the winnability engine
already has: the revolving-door indirect-newRoom resolution (rm40 -> rm43/44/45, which makes
Matches' room reachable), debug-global pinning, etc. Then it just subclasses SccReach.
